# Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="32px">

I'm Alex, a full stack developer based in Devon, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ originally from Gibraltar ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡®. I thrive on the challenge of problem-solving and finding creative solutions to complex issues. As a lifelong learner, I am always looking to expand my skillset and staying up-to-date with the latest tech, business and productivity.

I currently work at [Pixel Fridge](https://pixelfridge.digital), where I collaborate with a talented team of developers and designers to deliver high-quality projects that exceed client expectations and provide purposeful experiences that have a positive impact on people and the planet.

In my downtime, you can find me honing my musical skills on the guitar or drums, or unwinding with a game. Iâ€™m also making an effort to prioritize my health and fitness, and I'm starting to enjoy running and lifting weights.

Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me on any of the platforms listed below. Whether youâ€™re interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about our interests, Iâ€™m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals.
